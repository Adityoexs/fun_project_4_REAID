# AIO Chatbot Powered by OpenRouter

This AIO Chatbot is powered by **OpenRouter** and **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo** model. It allows users to interact with an AI assistant, ask questions, and receive intelligent responses. The chatbot is implemented using **Streamlit** for an interactive web-based interface.

## Features

- **AIO Chat Interaction**: The chatbot processes user input and returns a response based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- **History**: All previous chat interactions are displayed in a scrollable chat history.
- **Feedback**: Users can provide feedback on the assistant's response.
- **Validation**: Ensures the user provides valid input and handles API errors gracefully.
